## Introduction

Masa is the world's first Soulbound Token (SBT) Identity Protocol. Masa uses SBTs to represent users' attributes in web3
and in the real world, along with a protocol-level abstraction that enables the full management of SBTs and the data
attributed to them. The Masa Protocol provides the fundamental building blocks for a web3 identity management layer that
encapsulates any type of data attributed to an individual in the real world or in web3.

By creating an identity management layer that enables a plurality of SBTs, individuals can build a web3 identity
incrementally; Masa enables the full vision laid out by Vitalik Buterin et al. in the
paper, [Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763).

With Masa, metadata attributed to a soulbound token is encrypted and can only be accessed with permission from the
identity owner through the Masa Protocol.

## What are SBTs

Soulbound Tokens, proposed by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, will form an essential building block for a
Decentralized Society, or DeSoc. Soulbound Tokens are publicly visible, non-transferable, non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
that can serve as a web3 user’s identity that is intrinsically tied to their owners. These non-transferable tokens
represent credentials and affiliations within a DeSoc and are linked to Souls. Souls are a type of identifiable address
– generally a blockchain account, or in our case, an Ethereum wallet, that establishes provenance. A user can mint and
burn their SBTs.
