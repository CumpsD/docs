**_Soulbound domains_**

With Masa, you can build an engaged a loyal user base around your game or platform by issuing custom human readable domain names, handles, or aliases. A soulbound domain name is a human-readable address that resolves to a user’s wallet and any SBT identifiers associated with it. It is a combination of letters, numbers, and/or emojis. Soulbound domains  are minted as ERC-721 NFTs and through Masa’s SoulLinker contract are linkable to a Masa Identity (MID) and are easily resolvable to any SBT identirifer. Soulbound domains can be sold and traded on OpenSea by your users and are compatible with the OpenSea marketplace. 

**Using custom soulbound domain names you can**

- Create a custom domain name for your community members as a unique way to showcase community affinity. For example, if you run a corgi community, you can issue custom `.corgi` domain names through Masa.
- Create a custom domain name that represents a smart contract object within a metaverse game. An object might be a plot of land that is represented by a smart contract. Using a Soulname to create a naming convention for land plots enables easy customization of in-game object naming.
