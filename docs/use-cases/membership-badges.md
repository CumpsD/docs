# Membership badges

With Masa, you can build a membership program using non-transferable, soulbound badges. For example, a web3 gaming platform with active Discord communities can issue a membership badge to their longest-standing community members who will get perks, and access to exclusive offers, and souldrops. In this guide, we cover the steps for setting up a membership program using SBT Badges.

**Using soulbound membership badges you can**

- Mint a non-transferable, soulbound badge that represents a user‚Äôs community membership as proof-of-status. 
- Use soulbound membership badges as unique identifiers, you can give badge holders different access to perks and rewards.
- Use soulbound membership badges as unique identifiers, you can market to a specific group of users with membership badge SBTs in their wallets.

**For example:**
  - **Loyalty Program:** you can mint various tiers and types of ‚ÄúVIP / OG badges‚Äù to represent a user‚Äôs loyalty status in a tier-based membership program. 
  - **Ambassador Program:** you can mint various tiers and types of ‚Äúcontributor/moderator/ambassador badges‚Äù to represent a member‚Äôs community status
  - **Employee Program:** you can mint various membership badges to reward employees, such as ‚ÄúEmployee #1 / #2 / #3‚Äù

:::tip
You need to have the Masa CLI installed, if you have not completed the Quickstart you can do so here

## Install Masa SDK
This guide covers using the Masa SDK and Masa CLI to mint an Authority SBT (ASBT) on the Base Goerli Testnet. You can use either `yarn` or `npm` for the installation. 

### Install via yarn
```bash
yarn add @masa-finance/masa-sdk --save
```

### Install via npm
```bash
npm i @masa-finance/masa-sdk --save
```

## Deploy ASBT contract
In this guide we will use an Authority SBT that can be minted (dropped) directly to a users wallet without any user interaction with web3. 

### Deploy contract using CLI
```bash
masa deploy asbt --network basegorli 
```
 ```bash
  __  __                            ____   _       ___ 
 |  \/  |   __ _   ___    __ _     / ___| | |     |_ _|
