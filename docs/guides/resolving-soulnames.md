title: Resolving soulnames
---

# Introduction

A soulbound domain name is a human-readable address that resolves to a userâ€™s wallet. It is a combination of letters, numbers, and/or emojis. The Masa Protocol has minted over 200,000 .soul (e.g. vitalik.soul) and .celo (e.g. totheðŸª™.celo) domain names. Developers can integrate domain resolving of .soul and .celo names to get access to over 200,000+ unique wallets on Ethereum and Celo mainnets.
