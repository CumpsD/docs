# Issues

### Issue #1: **Setting Up the Basic libp2p Node**

**Description**: 
Initialize a basic `libp2p` node with essential configurations and peer discovery.

**Tasks**:
1. Install `libp2p` modules using npm or yarn.
2. Generate the node's identity using `libp2p-crypto`.
3. Define a custom transport protocol stack: TCP for local communication and WebSocket for browser-based interactions.
4. Activate the Kad-DHT module for peer discovery and routing.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Ensure the system has adequate resources for DHT since it can be resource-intensive.
- Monitor the nodeâ€™s CPU and memory usage when enabling multiple transports.

### Issue #2: **DHT Integration for Node Registration**

**Description**:
Integrate a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for node registration and discovery.

**Tasks**:
1. Use `@libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht` for DHT integration.
2. Define a protobuf schema for node details to ensure structured data storage in DHT.
3. Design a key-naming scheme to prevent key collisions when multiple nodes register.
4. Implement TTL (time-to-live) for DHT records to manage stale entries.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Account for network latency when setting TTL values.
- Ensure the DHT is initialized only after the libp2p node is fully started to avoid initialization errors.

### Issue #3: **Ethereum Smart Contract for Masa Token Staking**

**Description**:
Design and deploy an Ethereum smart contract.

**Tasks**:
1. Use the Solidity language for contract development.
2. Integrate with the ERC-20 "masa" token contract to manage staking operations.
3. Utilize OpenZeppelin libraries to ensure security and best practices.
4. Test the contract using `truffle` or `hardhat` on Ethereum testnets like Rinkeby or Ropsten.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Plan for gas optimization in the smart contract functions.
- Implement secure randomization for any reward distribution to deter attackers.

---

### Issue #4: **Integrate Node Validation with Masa Token Staking**

**Description**:
Connect the `libp2p` node with Ethereum for staking operations.

**Tasks**:
1. Utilize `web3.js` or `ethers.js` for Ethereum integration.
2. Store the Ethereum RPC endpoint securely, consider using environment variables.
3. Periodically poll the smart contract to validate the node's staked balance.
4. Automate the process of updating the node's status in DHT based on staking status.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Ensure Ethereum RPC calls are efficient to avoid rate limits.
- Cache staking status locally to reduce unnecessary Ethereum network calls.

### Issue #5: **Setup Webhook Data Receipt Mechanism**

**Description**:
Set up the `libp2p` node to accept incoming webhook data.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement a RESTful HTTP server, consider using `Express.js`.
2. Use middleware like `body-parser` for JSON payload parsing.
3. Store incoming data in a queue (like RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing.
4. Add error handlers for malformed payloads.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Ensure that the HTTP server is isolated from the main node process for security.

---

### Issue #6: **Data Propagation Across Nodes using libp2p**

**Description**:
Manage data propagation to other nodes.

**Tasks**:
1. Use `libp2p`'s Gossipsub or Floodsub for data propagation.
2. Serialize data using `protobuf` for efficient data transfer.
3. Implement a retry mechanism for failed data transfers.
4. Confirm data receipt with ACK messages.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Monitor bandwidth usage to prevent network congestion.
- Implement message compression to reduce data transfer sizes.

---

### Issue #7: **Implement Data Persistence with DHT Database**

**Description**:
Store webhook data persistently.

**Tasks**:
1. Install and configure `DHT Database`.
2. Define a data structure/schema with indexes for efficient querying.
3. Implement batch writes for improved performance.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Monitor disk I/O to ensure optimal performance.
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing.

---

### Issue #8: **Ethereum Transaction Management**

**Description**:
Manage Ethereum transactions.

**Tasks**:
1. Calculate optimal gas prices using services like `ETH Gas Station`.
2. Implement nonce management to avoid transaction collisions.
3. Use Ethereum events or logs for transaction status monitoring.
4. Implement a gas increment strategy for transaction resubmission.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Account for Ethereum network congestion when calculating gas prices.
- Store transaction hashes for future reference and auditing.

---

### Issue #9: **Node Rewarding System**

**Description**:
Facilitate node reward claims.

**Tasks**:
1. Monitor the Ethereum contract's events using web3.js or ethers.js event listeners.
2. Automate reward claims using smart contract function calls.
3. Implement a local ledger system to keep track of earned rewards.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Monitor for "out of gas" errors when claiming rewards.
- Sync the local ledger with the on-chain data periodically.

---

### Issue #10: **Security Enhancements**

**Description**:
Secure the system against threats.

**Tasks**:
1. Use `libp2p`'s SECIO or Noise for encrypted peer communication.
2. Implement rate limiting on all endpoints.
3. Regularly audit the Ethereum smart contract using tools like `Mythril` or `Slither`.

**Technical Considerations**:
- Monitor for any unusual node behavior or communication patterns.
- Update cryptographic libraries regularly to patch any vulnerabilities.
